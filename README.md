# Vision-based vehicle detection and counting system

A vehicle detection and counting system plays an important role for traffic management.The proposed method uses background subtraction technique to find foreground objects in a video sequence. In order to detect moving vehicles more accurately, several computer vision techniques, including thresholding and adaptive morphology operations, are then applied.
